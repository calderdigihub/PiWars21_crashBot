Group Repo for the College PiWars entry

## Introduction

Pi Wars is a non-destructive Raspberry Pi robotics competition with both autonomous and remote-controlled challenges. It takes place over one weekend and features teams of school students, family members and hobbyists as well as solo roboteers. The event is open to anyone on planet Earth! 

You design a robot controlled by a Raspberry Pi that competes to complete a series of challenges.

It's normally held over one weekend at the University of Cambridge but due to COVID the competition has been changed around for entrants to complete at home.
